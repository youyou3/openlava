.SH NAME
\fBlsb.stream\fR - OpenLava batch event stream files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
The OpenLava job event information could be used by any 3rd party program to
read in stream for process and analysis.
.PP
The format of the file is the same as lsb.events. A 3rd party program can
use OpenLava API lsb_geteventrec() to read and parse job event records from
it.
.PP
To enable this, add the parameter MAX_STREAM_RECORDS into lsb.params to specify
the maximum number of records each lsb.stream file should contain.
.PP
Whenever a host, job, or queue changes status, a record is appended
to the stream file \fBlsb.stream.0\fR. The file is located in
LSB_SHAREDIR/logdir/stream, where \fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR must be
defined in  lsf.conf(5). See mbatchd(8) for the description of
LSB_SHAREDIR.
