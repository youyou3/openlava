.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Displays the history of jobs.
Without option, by default, it displays history for all pending,
suspended, and running jobs that are owned by the user who invoked this
command.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]\-h\f[] Prints command usage to stderr and exits.
.PP
\f[B]\-V\f[] Prints OpenLava release version to stderr and exits.
.PP
\f[B]\-b\f[] Displays the job history in a brief format.
For the default, see \f[B]\-l\f[].
.PP
\f[B]\-l\f[] Displays the job history in a long format.
For each job, the detailed information is provided in with multiple
lines.
If neither \f[B]\-l\f[] nor \f[B]\-b\f[] is present, it displays the
fields in \f[B]SUMMARY\f[] only (see below).
.PP
\-w Displays the job history in a wide format.
.PP
\f[B]\-a\f[] Displays both finished and unfinished jobs.
This option overrides \f[B]\-d\f[], \f[B]\-p\f[], \f[B]\-s\f[], and
\f[B]\-r\f[].
If neither \f[B]\-a\f[] nor \f[B]\-d\f[] is present, then finished jobs
are not displayed.
.PP
\f[B]\-d\f[] Displays only the finished jobs.
.PP
\f[B]\-e\f[] Displays only the existed jobs.
.PP
\f[B]\-p\f[] Displays only the pending jobs.
.PP
\f[B]\-s\f[] Displays only the suspended jobs, and shows the reason why
each job was suspended (if option \f[B]\-l\f[] or \f[B]\-b\f[]
specified).
.PP
\f[B]\-r\f[] Displays only the running jobs.
.PP
\f[B]\-f\f[] \f[I]logfile\f[]_\f[I]name\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays job history information from a specified event log file.
Either an absolute or a relative path name may be specified.
The default is to use the event log file currently used by the OpenLava
system:
\f[B]$(LSB_SHAREDIR)/\f[]<\f[I]clustername\f[]>\f[B]/logdir/lsb.events\f[]
(see \f[I]lsb.events(5)\f[]).
Option \f[B]\-f\f[] is often used for off\-line analysis.
.PP
\f[B]\-n\f[] \f[I]num\f[]_\f[I]logfiles\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Specifies the number of event log files that \f[B]bhist\f[] searches.
The most recent \f[I]num\f[]_\f[I]logfiles\f[] log files are searched.
The default is 1; i.e., the current event log file,
\f[B]$(LSB_SHAREDIR)/\f[]<\f[I]clustername\f[]>\f[B]/logdir/lsb.events\f[]
\f[B](see\f[]
\f[I]lsb.events(5)\f[]) is searched.
If \f[I]num\f[]_\f[I]logfiles\f[] is 2, \f[B]bhist\f[] searches event
log files \f[B]lsb.events\f[] and \f[B]lsb.events.1\f[]; If
\f[I]num\f[]_\f[I]logfiles\f[] is 3, \f[B]bhist\f[] searches
\f[B]lsb.events\f[], \f[B]lsb.events.1\f[], and \f[B]lsb.events.2\f[];
and so on.
If \f[I]num\f[]_\f[I]logfiles\f[] is 0, all the event log files in
\f[B]$(LSB_SHAREDIR)/\f[]<\f[I]clustername\f[]>\f[B]/logdir\f[] are
searched.
.PP
\f[B]\-n\f[] \f[I]min_logfile, max_logfinle\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Specifies a range of event log files that \f[B]bhist\f[] searches.
The value of min_logfile and max_logfile represents the event log file
index.
For example, 2 represents \f[B]lsb.events.2\f[].
.PP
\f[B]\-C\f[] \f[I]time0\f[], \f[I]time1\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays only those jobs whose completion or exit time were within the
time interval between \f[I]time0\f[] and \f[I]time1\f[] (see
\f[B]TIME\f[] \f[B]FORMAT\f[] below).
.PP
\f[B]\-S\f[] \f[I]time0\f[], \f[I]time1\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays only those jobs whose submission time were within the time
interval between \f[I]time0\f[] and \f[I]time1\f[] (see \f[B]TIME\f[]
\f[B]FORMAT\f[] below).
.PP
\f[B]\-D\f[] \f[I]time0\f[], \f[I]time1\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays only those jobs whose dispatch time were within the time
interval between \f[I]time0\f[] and \f[I]time1\f[] (see \f[B]TIME\f[]
\f[B]FORMAT\f[] below).
.PP
\f[B]\-N\f[] \f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]spec\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays the CPU time by a normalized value.
\f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]spec\f[] is either a host name, or a host model name
defined in OpenLava, or a CPU factor (use
\f[I]lsinfo(1)\f[] to
get host model and CPU factor information).
If \f[B]bhist\f[] is used off line, i.e., without LIM, the only valid
usage for \f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]spec\f[] is a CPU factor.
The appropriate CPU scaling factor for the specified
\f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]spec\f[] is used to normalize the actual CPU time
consumed by the job.
.PP
\f[B]\-P\f[] \f[I]project_name\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays jobs belonging to the specified project \f[I]project_name\f[]
only.
.PP
\f[B]\-q\f[] \f[I]queue\f[]_\f[I]name\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays jobs submitted to the specified queue
\f[I]queue\f[]_\f[I]name\f[] only.
.PP
\f[B]\-m\f[] \f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]name\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays jobs dispatched to the specified host
\f[I]host\f[]_\f[I]name\f[] only.
.PP
\f[B]\-u\f[] \f[I]user\f[]_\f[I]name\f[] \f[B]|\f[] \f[B]\-u\f[]
\f[B]all\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays jobs that have been submitted by the user specified by
\f[I]user\f[]_\f[I]name\f[], or by all users (if the reserved user name
\f[B]all\f[] is specified).
The default is to display the jobs submitted by the user who invoked
this command.
.PP
\f[B]\-t\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays job events chronologically.
By default only displays records from the last week.
For different time periods use \[en]t with the \[en]T option.
.PP
\f[B]\-J\f[] \f[I]job\f[]_\f[I]name\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Displays the jobs that have the specified \f[I]job\f[]_\f[I]name\f[].
.PP

This option overrides all other options except \f[B]\-N\f[],
\f[B]\-h\f[] and \f[B]\-V\f[].
When it is used with \f[B]\-J\f[], only those jobs listed here that have
the specified \f[I]job\f[]_\f[I]name\f[] are displayed.

.SH TIME FORMAT
.PP
The «\f[I]time0\f[], \f[I]time1\f[]» in options of \f[B]\-C\f[],
\f[B]\-S\f[] and \f[B]\-D\f[] must conform to the following:
.PP
time_form = ptime,ptime | ptime, | ,ptime | itime
.PP
ptime = day | /day | month/ | year/month/day | year/month/day/ | hour: |
month/day | year/month/day/hour: | year/month/day/hour:minute |
day/hour: | month/day/hour: | day/hour:minute | hour:minute |
month/day/hour:minute | . | .\-itime
.PP
itime = ptime day, month, hour, minute = two digits
.PP
where `ptime\[aq] stands for a specific point of time, `itime\[aq]
stands for a specific interval of time, and `.\[aq] stands for the
current month/day/hour:minute.
.PP
Keeping the following rules in mind will help you to specify the time
freely:
.PP
\- \f[I]year\f[] must be 4 digits and followed by a /
.PP
\- \f[I]month\f[] must be followed by a / \- \f[I]day\f[] must be
preceded by a / \- \f[I]hour\f[] must be followed by a : \-
\f[I]minute\f[] must be preceded by a : \- The / before \f[I]day\f[] can
be omitted when \f[I]day\f[] stands alone or when \f[I]day\f[] is
followed by /\f[I]hour\f[]: \- No spaces are allowed in time format,
that is, the time must be a single string.
.PP
The above time format is designed for easy and flexible time
specification.
