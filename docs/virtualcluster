Master lim runs on the hosts as regular lim using the LSF_LIM_PORT
in lsf.conf. The virtual hosts are configured in lsf.cluster file
as:

Begin   Host
HOSTNAME    model   type  server  r1m  RESOURCES
lasagna    IntelI5  linux   1      3.5    (cs)
lasagna@9323    IntelI5  linux   1      3.5    (cs)
#lasagna@9324    IntelI5  linux   1      3.5    (cs)
End     Host

The virtual hosts must be configured in the hosts file in openlava
etc directory.

hostname@port where the port must not be equal to LSF_LIM_PORT.

Master lim uses the LSF_LIM_PORT, for its master announce to slaves 
it uses the port that is hardcoded in the hostname e.g. lasagna@9323.
It sends the master announce to lasagna at UDP port 9323.
Similarly when it receives statis info or load vector from
slaves it uses the port in the sockaddr_in structure to find
which lim is talking to it, since all the slaves run on the
master machine then it has the main hostNode.
